# rBreakout - Breakout clone written in Racket

This was a play project to try out some racket libraries such as

  * lux
  * mode-lambda
  * 3s

I also did all the sounds and sprites myself (that's why they're so awful :))
  
To start playing you have to compile the sprites first by running sprites.rkt
